## Assignment
Design a digital circuit that, given as input a sampled signal with a sampling period equal to T, gives as output an linearly interpolated version of the input signal. Use as interpolation factor L = 4 and a bit rappresentation of 16. \
Hence, for the net will generate L - 1 points every new point given as input.
